<p> MacRitchie Reservoir is the oldest reservoir, and has, in my opinion, the nicest reservoir park among the others. Its various nature trails make it a good place to go for trekking. </p>

<p> MacRitchie Reservoir Park is home to a diverse range of wildlife. There are many monkeys, insects, fish, turtles, and plants. It is one of the seventeen reservoirs in Singapore. These seventeen reservoirs make up one of four main taps that provide water to the residents of Singapore. </p>
