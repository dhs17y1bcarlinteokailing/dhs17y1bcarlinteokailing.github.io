<p> MacRitchie Reservoir is the oldest reservoir, and has, in my opinion, the nicest reservoir park among the others. Its various nature trails make it a good place to go for trekking. </p>

<p> MacRitchie Reservoir Park is home to a diverse range of wildlife. There are many monkeys, insects, fish, turtles, and plants. It is one of the seventeen reservoirs in Singapore. These seventeen reservoirs make up one of four main taps that provide water to the residents of Singapore. </p>
<p> Singapore has four national taps. We take our water from 1)seventeen reservoirs, 2) desalination, 3)imported water from Malaysia, 4)NEWater. As Singapore is a small island country, we do not have our own water resources. Luckily we have dicovered new ways to recycle water from our own waste and to treat rain water from the reservoirs.
