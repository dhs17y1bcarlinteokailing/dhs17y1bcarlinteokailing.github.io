   <h2>About</h2>
   <p>Hi! I am Carlin, a 13-year-old student from <a> href="http://www.dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg"</a> Dunman High School, Singapore.</p>
   <h2>Interests</h2>
   <p>I enjoy reading, I do a little sketching and colouring, play a bit of guitar, piano and ukelele. And sing. I like singing. I've been reading since young, but
   enjoy english books more than chinese books. If you need any book recommendations, just come to me (only for english books hehe). Maybe 
   try Poison Apples, or Throne of Glass, or Warriors... Books aside, let's move on to the arts. What I sketch might be complicated at 
   times, but I never do it myself. I have to go online to search for pictures. Mostly I draw animals, because people are too hard, and 
   nothing real life, thanks, unless it's plants. On a more musical note (geddit:P), I started piano at six, started guitar this year, and 
   try out ukelele occasionally. Currently I'm trying to find the sheet music for Sisi Ni Sawa, but with no luck. Sisi Ni Sawa is my current
   favourite song, despite it being for a kids' cartoon. There's a deep meaning in the song, so go look up the lyrics yourself!</p>
   <h3>Projects</h3>
   <p>Currently only this, although my dad did complete a house for my sister out of two cardboard boxes, complete with a functional door,
   windows and a little folding-out shop counter.</p>
