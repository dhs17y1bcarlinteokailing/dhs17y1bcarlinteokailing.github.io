<h1>Welcome to Carlin's home on the web!</h1>

<h2>Know me better!</h2>    
<p>Hi! I am Carlin, a 13-year-old student from Dunman High School, Singapore.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>I enjoy reading, I do a little sketching and colouring, play a bit of guitar, piano and ukelele. And sing. I like singing. I've been reading since young, but enjoy english books more than chinese books. If you need any book recommendations, just come to me (only for english books hehe). Maybe try Poison Apples, or Throne of Glass, or Warriors... Books aside, let's move on to the arts. What I sketch might be complicated at times, but I never do it myself. I have to go online to search for pictures. Mostly I draw animals, because people are too hard, and nothing real life, thanks, unless it's plants. On a more musical note (geddit:P), I started piano at six, started guitar this year, and try out ukelele occasionally. Currently I'm trying to find the sheet music for Sisi Ni Sawa, but with no luck. Sisi Ni Sawa is my current favourite song, despite it being for a kids' cartoon. There's a deep meaning in the song, so go look up the lyrics yourself!</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>I have many projects given by my teachers on my previous learning journeys with my class. We went to <a href="page2.html"> MacRitchie Reservoir</a> and Lee Kong Chian Natural History Muesuem.</p>
